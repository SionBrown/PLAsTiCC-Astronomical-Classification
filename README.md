Kaggle Competition

## Getting Started

Please refer to the [exploratory data analysis document](https://github.com/SionBrown/PLAsTiCC-Astronomical-Classification/blob/master/ExploritoryDataAnalysis.md) before delving into the feature engineering document for an insight as to how significant features were engineered to improve classification of astronomical objects. 

### Prerequisites

Below is a list of prerequisites to install;

### Installing

Please visit [Python.org](https://www.python.org/) to download the Python sourcecode and installers. It is recommended to download the latest version but for your information Python 3.6.6 was used.
