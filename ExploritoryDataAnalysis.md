# Exploritory Data Analysis 
Exploratory analysis of the data revealed that there were a signiÔ¨Åcant number of NaN values for the distance modulus. For distance modulus observations that were NaN a pattern emerged that the photometric redshift (hostgal photoz) was equal to zero. 

According to the [data note](https://www.kaggle.com/c/PLAsTiCC-2018/data) of the competition the given redshift for objects in our own Milky Way galaxy is given as zero inferring that the objects with NaN distance modulus are objects within our galaxy. This makes it possible to split the dataset into objects in our galaxy and extragalactic objects. We can therefore visualise the frequency distribution of the target classes for galactic or extragalactic objects as shown in figure \ref{img1}
